# fibautomata



This is a visualization of a summing reduction as a grid.

The single digit integer elements of two arrays A and B are summed and reduced additively to get array C.
Those arrays are plotted as rows in a grid.  The colors are HSB with 1 being red and 9 being violet, and the rest in between colors.
Each next line is made up of the previous two, Fibonacci numbers.

The first image which looks very much like a stained glass window is seeded with two arrays of fibonacci 24 numbers.

The others are random arrays of single digit integers as seeds. 

You get some nice patterns and structure from random seeds too.

It grows a bit like the 1d cellular automata or perhaps 1.1d since it takes two rows to get the third ;)

If you click the mouse on either it will randomly create two arrays of integers.  Then it will use the same process of  getting the reduced sum of its two immediately previous terms to draw the next line.
